title: Link
---

import {Link} from '@salad-ui/link';
import {Body} from '@salad-ui/typography';
export const scope = {Link, Body};

Links let users take actions and make choices with a single click or tap.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @salad-ui/link
```

## Usage

```jsx
import {Link} from '@salad-ui/link';
import {Body} from '@salad-ui/link';

<>
  <Body>
    Learn{' '}
    <Link href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/pony" rel="nofollow">
      How to Ride a PONY
    </Link>{' '}
    with The Oatmeal.
  </Body>
  <Body>
    Visit our{' '}
    <Link isSubtle href="https://www.nib.com.au/contact-us" rel="nofollow">
      Contact Us
    </Link>{' '}
    page to find retail centres, opening hours and more.
  </Body>
  <Body>
    A <Link onClick={() => action('foo')}>button that looks like a link</Link>.
  </Body>
</>;
```

Avoid using buttons that look like links (`<Link onClick={...}>`) as they may not behave as the user expected i.e. they can't be ctl-clicked and opened in a new tab.

### Usage with React Router, Gatsby and other frameworks that provide their own `<Link/>` component

SPA frameworks like `react-router` will provide their own `Link` component for navigation between pages of the application.

```jsx previewable=false
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import {Link as StyledLink} from '@salad-ui/link';

<Link to="/other-page" component={StyledLink}>
  Go to the other page!
</Link>;
```

## Properties

<Props component={Link} />
