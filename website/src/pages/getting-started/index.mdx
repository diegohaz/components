🥗 `salad-ui` is a set of components for building rich user interfaces within `wp-admin`.

## Installation

### In WordPress

> ⏲ Coming soon!

### In a bundled application

Each component exists as a seperately isntallable NPM package allowing you to upgrade as desired.
Most packages have a peer dependency on `react` and `styled-components` so make sure you install them
alongside any `@salad-ui/*` packages you choose to use.

NPM

```bash
npm install react styled-components @salad-ui/theme @salad-ui/button --save
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add react styled-components @salad-ui/theme @salad-ui/button
```

_`salad-ui` assumes your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods. Learn more about it in [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/caveats)._

## Usage

Setup the theme

Import the components necessary to build your user interfaces.

```jsx
import {Button} from '@salad-ui/button';

export const App = () => {
  const save = () => alert('Saved!');
  return (
    <>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={save}>
        Save
      </Button>
    </>
  );
};
```
