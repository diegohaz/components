Practice [mobile-first design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/).

The supported viewport sizes are:

<BreakpointExample />

Most components and utility functions have properties which can be configured responsively based on the screen size. There are also utility functions to apply your own styles at breakpoints.

## Installation

```
npm install @salad-ui/breakpoint
```

## Usage

## breakpoint

A utility function that applies styles at a single breakpoint.

```jsx inline=false
import styled from 'styled-components';
import breakpoint from '@salad-ui/breakpoint';

const Heading = styled.span`
  ${breakpoint('mobile')`
    color: green;
  `}
  ${breakpoint('tablet')`
    color: red;
  `}
  ${breakpoint('desktop')`
    color: blue;
  `}
`;

render(<Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>);
```

## map

A utility function that applies styles across multiple breakpoints.

```jsx inline=false
import styled from 'styled-components';
import {map} from '@salad-ui/breakpoint';

const Heading = styled.span`
  ${map(
    {mobile: 'red', tablet: 'green', desktop: 'blue'},
    color => `color: ${color};`,
  )}
`;

render(<Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>);
```
