title: Button
---

import {Button} from '@salad-ui/button';
export const scope = {Button};

Buttons let users take actions and make choices with a single click or tap.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @salad-ui/button
```

## Usage

```jsx
import {Button} from '@salad-ui/button';
<>
  <Button variant="tertiary" onClick={() => alert('saving')}>
    Save Draft
  </Button>{' '}
  <Button variant="secondary" href="/preview">
    Preview
  </Button>{' '}
  <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('publishing')}>
    Publish
  </Button>
</>;
```

Avoid using buttons for navigation. Avoid using links that look like buttons - they aren't fully compliant - holding down space doesn't trigger the :active state like a normal button.

### Usage with React Router, Gatsby and other frameworks that provide their own `<Link/>` component

SPA frameworks like `react-router` will provide their own `Link` component for navigation between pages of the application.

```jsx previewable=false
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import {Button} from '@salad-ui/button';

<Link to="/other-page" component={Button}>
  Perfom the action!
</Link>;
```

## Properties

<Props component={Button} />
