title: Link

import {Link} from '@salad-ui/link';
import {Example, PropTable} from '../../components';

Links let users take actions and make choices with a single click or tap.

### Example

<Example>

Learn <Link href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics/pony" rel="nofollow">How to Ride a PONY</Link> with The Oatmeal.

Visit our <Link isSubtle href="https://www.nib.com.au/contact-us" rel="nofollow">Contact Us</Link> page to find retail centres, opening hours and more.

A <Link onClick={() => action('foo')}>button that looks like a link</Link>.

</Example>

Avoid using buttons that look like links (`<Link onClick={...}>`) as they may not behave as the user expected i.e. they can't be ctl-clicked and opened in a new tab.

### Usage with ReactRouter, Gatsby and other frameworks that use their own `<Link/>` component

```tsx
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import {Link as StyledLink} from '@salad-ui/link'

<Link to="/other-page" component={StyledLink}>Go to the other page!</Link>
```

<PropTable component={Link} />
