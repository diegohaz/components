Practice [mobile-first design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/).

The screen sizes that we have chosen to design, implement and support are:

<BreakpointTable/>

Most utilities and components have properties which can be configured responsively based on the screen size. We also provide a 
number of utilities to apply your own styles at breakpoints.

# Utilities

## breakpoint

A utility function used to apply styles at a single breakpoint.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import breakpoint from '@salad-ui/breakpoint';

const Heading = styled.h1`
  ${breakpoint('mobile')`
    color: green;
  `}
  ${breakpoint('tablet')`
    color: red;
  `}
  ${breakpoint('desktop')`
    color: blue;
  `}
`;

```

## map

A utility function used to apply styles across multiple breakpoints.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import {map} from '@salad-ui/breakpoint';

const Heading = styled.h1`
  ${map(
    {mobile: 'red', tablet: 'green', desktop: 'blue'}, 
    color => `color: ${color};`
  )}
`;

```
